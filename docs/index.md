In 2020, as the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) spread across the globe, a majority of countries announced the temporary closure of schools, impacting more than 91 per cent of students worldwide. By April 2020, close to 1.6 billion children and youth were out of school.

To address this issue, during the [biohackathon](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/wiki) organised on April 5-11, 2020 by the international bioinformatics community, one of the topics presented among others will be the possibility of working on a topic entitled: **home-learning**. [Pitagora Network](https://pitagora-network.org/) together with [ELIXIR-FR](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/france), worked on this topic with the following objectives:

- Developed new training material in a collaborative way related to coronavirus topic
- Establish training material for an asynchronous approach, easy to adapt and quick to use for learners
- Promote "atomic topics" with less than 10 minutes for the lesson
- Be able to work with several translations at the same time
