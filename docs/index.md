In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, a majority of countries announced the temporary closure of schools, impacting more than 91 per cent of students worldwide. By April 2020, close to 1.6 billion children and youth were out of school.

To address this issue, during the biohackathon organised on April 5-11 2020 by the international bioinformatics community, one of the topics presented among others will be the possibility of working on a topic entitled: **home-learning**.

- Develop "atomic topics" with less than 10 minutes for the lesson
- Be able to work with several translations at the same time
